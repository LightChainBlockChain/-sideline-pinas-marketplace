# Sideline Pinas powered by VeriToken (DID/SSI)

A privacy-preserving identity and credentials layer integrated with the Sideline Pinas digital marketplace. This document consolidates the decentralized identity (DID) and self-sovereign identity (SSI) concepts, architecture, and example usage for a sustainable integration.

## Overview

VeriToken Marketplace extends DID/VC standards (W3C DID, Verifiable Credentials) to support secure marketplace flows:
- Merchant and customer verification with selective disclosure
- Product authenticity and supply-chain provenance
- Transaction attestations for trust and compliance

This enables secure, privacy-preserving commerce using verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers without over-collecting personal data.

## Architecture (Conceptual)

```

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js             # Main marketplace system entry

## Core Capabilities

- Marketplace DID Schemas:
  - MerchantDID: business identity, verification levels, reputation
  - CustomerDID: KYC levels, privacy controls
  - ProductDID: authenticity, supply-chain tracking
  - TransactionDID: transaction attestation/verification

- Credential Issuance System:
  - Merchant, Customer, Product, and Transaction credentials

- Wallet & Onboarding:
  - MarketplaceWallet with multi-identity support
  - Connection management and credential storage
  - Selective disclosure and ZK-proof generation (conceptual)

- API Endpoints (conceptual):
  - Identity, Wallet, Onboarding, Product Authenticity, Credentials, Transactions, Stats

## Security Features

- Ed25519 signatures
- Local key storage (private keys remain on device)
- Selective disclosure (least-privilege sharing)
- Zero-knowledge proofs (where supported)
- Decentralized architecture (no single point of failure)

## Development Roadmap (Snapshot)

- Phase 2: Core Integration â€” Completed
  - Wallet integration, onboarding, product authenticity, basic APIs
- Phase 3: TikTok-inspired marketplace â€” Completed
  - Creator profiles, short-form content, affiliate tracking, social features, analytics, REST API
- Phase 4: Advanced Features â€” Next
  - Advanced ZK proofs, decentralized reputation, interoperability, privacy controls, smart contracts, mobile wallet, dispute resolution, AI recommendations

## Sustainable Integration Guidance

- Separation of concerns: keep DID/SSI logic isolated from marketplace business logic
- Clear interfaces: define schemas and endpoints with versioning
- Testability: unit-test DID operations and credential flows
- Compliance: document data handling and retention policies
- Observability: add metrics on credential issuance/verification (no PII)
- Backwards compatibility: version credentials and APIs to allow gradual upgrades
